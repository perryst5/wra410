Strategy

    My site is for the user who loves music.
    The goal of the site is to be a place to catalog the user's home record library.
    Additionally, the user can connect with other users or friends and talk about their albums.
    The site will have a friending feature, where albums can be traded.
    The site can be used to track loaned records, ensuring the the user knows where his records are.
    Ideally, the database should be able to autocomplete forms if it finds that a record has been entered before by another user.
    Profile pages will be available, where users can show off their favorite albums.
    Lastly, the site could be a place for users to show off their collections. It does need a bit better branding, including a name and logo.
